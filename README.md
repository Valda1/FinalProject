Project idea is to create an e-mail client software where user can create an e-mail address or log into existing e-mail account and send or delete e-mails and create a contact list.
At the moment operations available are:

•	User registration/creating new e-mail address

•	Existing user log in

•	Sending an e-mail

•	Deleting an e-mail

•	Printing out sent e-mails list

•	Adding new contact to the contact list

•	Deleting a contact person from the contact list

•	Printing out the contact list
